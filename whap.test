The whap module
===============

	>>> import whap
	>>> print whap.__doc__
	This small script offers a python equivalent to "which"
	...

More modules for testing
------------------------

	>>> import os

Paths to modules
----------------

Here's one python file we know exists:
	>>> os.path.isfile(whap.__file__)
	True

	>>> directory = os.path.dirname(whap.__file__)
	>>> filename = os.path.basename(whap.__file__)

Depending on current status, that might be whap.py or whap.pyc
	>>> name, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
	>>> ext in ['.py', '.pyc']
	True

This method gives the file in the directory,
	but always prefers source over compiled
	>>> print whap.path_to_module(directory, 'whap')
	/.../whap.py

Paths to packages
-----------------

Hard to test this, as no guarantee there are any known packages around
	best to go with one of the standard python packages
	>>> directory = os.path.dirname(os.__file__)
	>>> print whap.path_to_sub_directory(directory, 'compiler')
	/.../compiler
