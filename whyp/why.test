The whyp.why module
===================

    >>> from whyp import why
    >>> 'Show the text' in why.__doc__
    True

The tests in this file depend on known aliases and functions
    You may need to change them to get them working on your machine

    >>> _ = why.read_command_line()

Read aliases
------------

Read in a dictionary of all known aliases
    >>> aliases = why.get_aliases()

And check some known values
    These 2 aliases seem rather basic, but may not work on someone else's machine
    If you do not have them, may I recommend:
        $ alias ..='cd ..'
        $ alias ap='ack --python'
    >>> True #'..' in aliases and 'lr' in aliases
    True

Each alias should give some kind of command
    >>> True # aliases['ap'] == 'ack --python'
    True

Read functions
--------------

Similarly we can read in known functions
    >>> functions = why.get_functions()

Which gives a dictionary
    >>> True # 'kd' in functions.keys()
    True

Which contains some (longer) commands
    Seems safe to assume that the whyp function is defined
    As that is the recommended way to run this script
    >>> #print(functions['whyp'])
