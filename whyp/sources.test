The whyp.sources module
=======================

    >>> from whyp import sources
    >>> assert 'aliases / functions from source files' in sources.__doc__

More modules for testing
------------------------

    >>> from os.path  import basename

Functions to get sourced files
------------------------------

Should be some files sourced already
    >>> assert sources.any()

And our shell script should be one of them
    >>> assert 'whyp.sh' in [basename(s) for s in sources.all()]
