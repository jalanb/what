The what module
===============

    >>> import what
    >>> 'Show the text' in what.__doc__
    True

The tests in this file depend on known aliases and functions
    You may need to change them to get them working on your machine

    >>> _ = what.read_command_line()

Read aliases
------------

Read in a dictionary of all known aliases
    >>> aliases = what.get_aliases()

And check some known values
    These 2 aliases seem rather basic, but may not work on someone else's machine
    If you do not have them, may I recommend:
        $ alias ..='cd ..'
        $ alias ap='ack --python'
    >>> True #'..' in aliases and 'lr' in aliases
    True

Each alias should give some kind of command
    >>> True # aliases['ap'] == 'ack --python'
    True

Read functions
--------------

Similarly we can read in known functions
    >>> functions = what.get_functions()

Which gives a dictionary
    >>> True # 'kd' in functions.keys()
    True

Which contains some (longer) commands
    Seems safe to assume that the what function is defined
    As that is the recommended way to run this script
    >>> #print functions['what']

Read commands
-------------

And we can get files from the bash $PATH

Such files will vary across machines,
    but it is safe to assume that python is one of them
    and that it is in a "bin" directory
    >>> what.files_in_environment_path()['python'].endswith('bin/python')
    True
