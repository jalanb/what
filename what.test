The what module
===============

	>>> import what
	>>> print what.__doc__
	Show the text behind commands
	...

The tests in this file depend on known aliases and functions
	You may need to change them to get them working on your machine

	>>> _ = what.read_command_line()

Read aliases
------------

Read in a dictionary of all known aliases
	>>> aliases = what.get_aliases()

And check some known values
	These 2 aliases seem rather basic, but may not work on someone else's machine
	If you do not have them, may I recommend:
		$ alias ..='cd ..'
		$ alias ap='ack --python'
	>>> '..' in aliases and 'ap' in aliases
	True

Each alias should give some kind of command
	>>> aliases['ap'] == 'ack --python'
	True

Read functions
--------------

Similarly we can read in known functions
	>>> functions = what.get_functions()

Which gives a dictionary
	>>> 'what' in functions.keys()
	True

Which contains some (longer) commands
	Seems safe to assume that the what function is defined
	As that is the recommended way to run this script
	>>> print functions['what']
	what ()
	{
	...
	python .../what.py ...
	...
	}

Read commands
-------------

And we can get files from the bash $PATH

Such files will vary across machines,
	but it is safe to assume that python is one of them
	and that it is in a "bin" directory
	>>> print what.files_in_environment_path()['python'] 
	/.../bin/python
